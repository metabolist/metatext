Note that capacity for reviewing pull requests is currently very limited. For now, please limit the scope of proposed changes to fixing bugs and not added features, settings, or behavior, thanks. If you are interested in doing a larger scope change, please propose it via email at info@metabolist.org first.

## Building

To build Metatext:

- Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/metabolist/metatext.git`)
- Open `Metatext.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- Select the top-level "Metatext" item in Xcode and change the team in each target's "Signing & Capabilities" settings to your own

All dependencies are managed using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) and will automatically be installed by Xcode.

### Push Notifications

Push notifications will not work in development builds of Metatext unless you host your own instance of [metatext-apns](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext-apns) and change the `pushSubscriptionEndpointURL` constants in [IdentityService.swift](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext/blob/main/ServiceLayer/Sources/ServiceLayer/Services/IdentityService.swift) to its URL.

## Architecture

- Metatext uses the [Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel).
- View models are clients of a service layer that abstracts network and local database logic.
- Different levels of the architecture are in different local Swift Packages. `import DB` and `import MastodonAPI` should generally only be done within the `ServiceLayer` package, and `import ServiceLayer` only within the `ViewModels` package.
